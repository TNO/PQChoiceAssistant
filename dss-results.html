                <h3>Brief descriptions of the schemes</h3>
                <br>

                <p>
                    <strong>ML-DSA (module lattice digital signature algorithm)</strong>, based on
                    CRYSTALS-Dilithium, is a signature scheme based on module lattices. It has been
                    selected by NIST for standardization and is recommended as primary algorithm.
                    ML-DSA provides high efficiency in creating signatures as well as generating keys.
                </p>
                <p>• <u>Pros:</u> Fast key generation and signing, relatively small signatures.</p>
                <p>• <u>Cons:</u> Somewhat less conservative approach.</p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    <strong>Falcon</strong> is quite similar to ML-DSA: it is also based on module
                    lattices and has similar efficiency. NIST also selected Falcon, and recommends
                    it for applications requiring smaller signatures than ML-DSA is able to create.
                    Falcon can also verify signatures faster than ML-DSA.
                </p>
                <p>• <u>Pros:</u> Small sizes and fast verification.</p>
                <p>• <u>Cons:</u> Design makes it difficult to put side-channel countermeasures in place,
                    somewhat less conservative approach.</p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    <strong>SLH-DSA (stateless hash-based digital signature algorithm)</strong>, based
                    on SPHINCS+, is a hash-based signature scheme also selected for standardization by
                    NIST. It stands out by the fact that it has very small public and secret keys, has
                    good hardware integration and is assumed to be very secure, but also is very slow
                    at generating keys, as well as creating and verifying signatures.
                </p>
                <p>• <u>Pros:</u> High security, based on well-established cryptographic assumptions, small public key.</p>
                <p>• <u>Cons:</u> Large signatures and slower performance, especially for signature generation.</p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    <strong>XMSS (extended Merkle signature scheme)</strong> is also a hash-based
                    signature scheme. It is the only stateful scheme out of these four, meaning a
                    state has to be maintained between operations. This is undesirable in many
                    applications. On the other hand, XMSS does offer efficient operations and strong
                    security. NIST has published a recommendation for XMSS based on IETF RFC 8391.
                </p>
                <p>• <u>Pros:</u> Strong security, size relatively small, fast verification.</p>
                <p>• <u>Cons:</u> State is hard to handle, limited number of signatures, reducing applicability significantly.</p>
                <br>

                <br>
                <h3>Scoring system</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The schemes are scored as follows. For every question number between 2 and 9, a
                    score between 0 and 5 is given to each scheme. This score depends on your answer,
                    with higher scores given to schemes that fit best with your answer. If you decide
                    to answer questions marked as expert questions, these take precedence over the
                    regular question covering the same topic. Questions you marked important count double.
                    At the end, each final score is normalized to be between 0 and 100 and displayed,
                    as it is above.
