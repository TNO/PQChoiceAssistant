                <h3>Brief descriptions of the schemes</h3>
                <br>

                <p>
                    <strong>ML-KEM (module lattice KEM)</strong>, based on CRYSTALS-Kyber, is a KEM
                    based on a variant of the learning with errors (LWE) lattice problem. It was
                    introduced in 2018 and won the NIST competition for a PQC standard in 2022. ML-KEM
                    distinguishes itself from alternatives by being fast at encryption, decryption
                    and key generation, while also having small keys.
                </p>
                <p>• <u>Pros:</u> Very efficient, relatively small sizes, simple to implement in hardware.</p>
                <p>• <u>Cons:</u> Somewhat less conservative.</p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    <strong>FrodoKEM</strong>, is also based on the LWE problem. Unlike ML-KEM, it
                    relies on a more general variant of the LWE problem. While there is no evidence
                    that the added structure that ML-KEM uses introduces any vulnerabilities, it makes
                    that FrodoKEM is considered a more conservative choice for not having this structure.
                    On the other hand, this makes FrodoKEM an overall less efficient scheme.
                </p>
                <p>• <u>Pros:</u> More conservative choice than module lattices.</p>
                <p>• <u>Cons:</u> Smaller session keys, requires more frequent session refreshing.
                    Larger sizes and slower performance than module lattices.</p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    <strong>Classic McEliece</strong> stands out from the two schemes above, as it is
                    not based on lattice problems, but on error-correcting codes. It is also by far
                    the oldest and most mature scheme of the three, being proposed in the 1970s. This
                    makes it also the most conservative option, as no significant vulnerabilities have
                    been found in over 40 years. Conversely, McEliece uses very large keys, which makes
                    it impractical for many use cases.
                </p>
                <p>• <u>Pros:</u> Very conservative choice, one of the oldest PQC schemes developed, small ciphertexts.</p>
                <p>• <u>Cons:</u> Very large public keys and slow key generation.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Scoring system</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The schemes are scored as follows. For every question number between 2 and 8, a
                    score between 0 and 5 is given to each scheme. This score depends on your answer,
                    with higher scores given to schemes that fit best with your answer. If you decide
                    to answer questions marked as expert questions, these take precedence over the
                    regular question covering the same topic. Questions you marked important count
                    double. At the end, each final score is normalized to be between 0 and 100 and
                    displayed, as it is above.
