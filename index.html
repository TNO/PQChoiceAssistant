                <p>Welcome to the <strong>PQChoiceAssistant!</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Here you can get advice on the feasibility of various post-quantum cryptographic
                    algorithms in your use-case.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We make a distinction between Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) and Digital
                    Signature Scheme (DSS) algorithms. Currently, we support ML-KEM, Classic McEliece
                    and FrodoKEM as KEMs, and Falcon, ML-DSA, XMSS and SLH-DSA as DSSes. These are the
                    most prominent candidates, as they are either accepted as a NIST standard or have
                    governmental support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By answering relevant questions about your situation,
                    you are able to see recommendations on the most well-suited option.
                </p>

                    The PQChoiceAssistant is a tool developed by TNO and Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica,
                    with the support of Fox Crypto, NXP, Technolution and Compumatica, commissioned
                    by the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD)
                    and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy (min. EZK), and executed
                    under the dcypher roadmap Cryptography.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In March 2023, we published the
                    <a href="https://www.tno.nl/en/newsroom/2023/04-0/pqc-migration-handbook/">PQC Migration Handbook</a>,
                    which assists organisations in mitigating the threat of quantum computers on currently
                    used cryptography, by providing concrete steps and advice. The PQChoiceAssistant
                    is an extension to the PQC Migration Handbook. After the PQC Diagnosis, in which
                    the vulnerable cryptography is identified, the PQChoiceAssistant assists in making
                    the choice of which algorithm(s) to migrate to.
