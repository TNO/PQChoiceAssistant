                <p>Please answer the following questions.</p>
                <p>
                    For advanced users with extensive cryptographic knowledge,
                    expert questions are available to get more finetuned results.
                    You are free to skip these questions if you are not sure. Note that expert
                    questions replace the scoring of the corresponding regular question, e.g., when
                    answering expert question 5-1, the answer to question 5 will be disregarded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most questions are also accompanied by a brief introduction illustrating the idea
                    behind the question.
                </p>
